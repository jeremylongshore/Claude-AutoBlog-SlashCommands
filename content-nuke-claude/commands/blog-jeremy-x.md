Generate and publish a portfolio blog post to jeremylongshore.com AND create a Twitter/X thread in one command.

## Your Task

This command creates a blog post for jeremylongshore.com (professional/career audience) AND generates a Twitter/X thread to promote it.

### Phase 1: Analyze Working Session (Once)

1. **Analyze ENTIRE Working Session**
   - **Git History**: Check commits since the most recent post date in `/home/jeremy/projects/blog/jeremylongshore/content/posts/` (fallback: last 24 hours)
   - **Current Conversation**: Review the COMPLETE conversation history from this session
     - What problem were we solving?
     - What questions did Jeremy ask?
     - What solutions did we try that failed?
     - What troubleshooting steps did we take?
     - What was the iterative problem-solving process?
     - What did we learn along the way?
   - **Project Context**: Examine file changes, TODO lists, CLAUDE.md files in CURRENT directory
   - **Missed Opportunities**: Identify anything valuable we worked on that might not be in git yet
   - **The Journey**: Capture the full story - false starts, pivots, discoveries, not just the final solution

2. **Find Cross-Links**
   - Search existing posts in `/home/jeremy/projects/blog/jeremylongshore/content/posts/`
   - Identify 2-3 related posts by keyword/topic matching
   - Note their titles and URLs for linking

### Phase 2: Write Portfolio Blog Post

3. **Write Portfolio Blog Post**
   - **Tone:** Professional, career-focused, demonstrates problem-solving
   - **Style:** Narrative showcasing capabilities for employers/clients
   - **Same content, different narrative:**
     - Title (career-impact focused)
     - Challenge (business/professional context)
     - Approach (problem-solving methodology)
     - Solution (what was delivered)
     - Skills Demonstrated (highlight technical and soft skills)
     - Impact (professional growth, portfolio value)
     - Related Work (cross-links to 2-3 portfolio posts)
   - **Focus:** Problem-solving capabilities and professional growth
   - **Audience:** Employers, clients, recruiters
   - Use Hugo front matter (TOML format):
     ```toml
     +++
     title = 'Professional Title'
     date = 2025-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-05:00
     draft = false
     tags = ["career", "skills"]
     +++
     ```

### Phase 3: Ask for Thread Size

4. **Prompt for Thread Size**
   - Ask: "Thread size? (1-7)"
   - User responds with just the number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7
   - Default to 3 if no response

### Phase 4: Generate X Thread

5. **Generate Professional X Thread (X-Gen-System)**

   **Input Processing:**
   - Extract career insights and professional achievements from blog content
   - Set X-Gen parameters for professional audience:
     ```json
     {
       "topic": "[professional achievement/skill demonstrated]",
       "raw": "[key career insights and problem-solving approach from blog]",
       "goal": "engagement",
       "tone": "friendly",
       "include_link": "[jeremylongshore.com blog post URL]",
       "hashtags": ["[professional/career tags]"],
       "cta_preference": "ask",
       "audience_level": "intermediate",
       "max_posts": "[user-specified 1-7]"
     }
     ```

   **Professional X-Gen Processing:**
   - Apply character budgeting with professional messaging constraints
   - Generate career-focused hook highlighting problem-solving capabilities
   - Structure content to showcase professional competence and growth
   - Integrate professional hashtags naturally (max 2, CamelCase)
   - Include portfolio blog link with compelling context
   - Apply accessibility and professional tone validation

- SEO-optimized with career-relevant tags

## Thread Best Practices (Professional Focus)

- **Methodology focus** - show your problem-solving approach
- **Career hashtags** - #SoftwareDeveloper #OpenSource #TechLeadership etc.

## Critical Reminders

## Response Options

After showing drafts:
- **"yes"** - Publish blog post and save X thread
- **"edit"** - Make changes before publishing
- **"cancel"** - Don't publish either

## Example Invocation

1. Analyzes the complete session
2. Asks "Thread size? (1-7)"
3. User responds "4"
4. Generates portfolio blog post + 4-tweet professional thread
5. Shows both for review
6. Publishes blog + saves thread after approval

**Result:** Portfolio blog post live on jeremylongshore.com + professional X thread ready to copy-paste within 5 minutes.
