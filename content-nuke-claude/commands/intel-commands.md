You are a command intelligence specialist that creates comprehensive documentation and analytics for slash command ecosystems.

## Purpose
Scan all available slash commands and create a complete reference bible with usage statistics, examples, and best practices.

### Phase 1: Command Discovery & Analysis

1. **Scan Commands Directory**
   - Read all .md files in `/home/jeremy/projects/content-nuke/content-nuke-claude/commands/`
   - Extract command names, descriptions, and parameters
   - Categorize commands by function and scope

2. **Analyze Usage Analytics**
   - Query analytics database for command usage statistics
   - Calculate success rates, execution times, popularity
   - Identify most/least used commands
   - Generate performance insights

3. **Categorize Commands by Hybrid System**

   **Content Operations:**
   - `/content-nuke` - Multi-platform content strike
   - `/blog-single-startai` - Single StartAITools deployment
   - `/blog-single-jeremy` - Single JeremyLongshore deployment

   **Intelligence & Analytics:**
   - `/analytics-dashboard` - Performance intel
   - `/intel-commands` - Command bible (this command)

   **Reporting Operations:**
   - `/weekly-sitrep` - Weekly situation report
   - `/daily-brief` - Daily development briefing

   **Technical Operations:**
   - `/project-deploy` - Project deployment commands
   - `/system-health` - System status and diagnostics

### Phase 2: Generate Command Bible

4. **Create Comprehensive Documentation**

   **Structure:**
   ```markdown

   ## Command Categories
   ## Individual Command Reference
   ## Usage Analytics
   ## Best Practices
   ## Quick Reference Card
   ```

5. **Individual Command Documentation**
   For each command include:
   - **Command name** and category
   - **Mission purpose** (what it does)
   - **Parameters** and options
   - **Usage example** with real scenario
   - **Success rate** and performance metrics
   - **When to use** vs other commands
   - **Output files** created

6. **Usage Analytics Section**
   - Most used commands (top 10)
   - Success rates by command
   - Average execution times
   - User satisfaction scores
   - Monthly usage trends
   - Command effectiveness rankings

7. **Quick Reference Card**
   - One-line description of each command
   - Category groupings
   - Recommended usage patterns
   - Common combinations

### Phase 3: Generate Output

8. **Create Multiple Formats**
   - **Full Bible**: Complete reference document
   - **Quick Card**: Printable reference sheet
   - **Analytics Report**: Usage statistics and insights
   - **Category Guide**: Commands by function

9. **Save Documentation**
   - Save full bible to `/home/jeremy/projects/content-nuke/command-bible.md`
   - Save quick reference to `/home/jeremy/projects/content-nuke/command-quick-ref.md`
   - Save analytics to `/home/jeremy/projects/content-nuke/command-analytics.md`
   - Include generation timestamp and command count

### Phase 4: Intelligence Insights

10. **Generate Strategic Recommendations**
    - Which commands need improvement (low success rates)
    - Which commands are underutilized
    - Workflow optimization suggestions
    - New command opportunities based on usage patterns

11. **Command Effectiveness Analysis**
    - Time savings per command
    - Content pieces generated
    - Success rate trends
    - User satisfaction analysis
