X API OAuth 1.0a Posting Fix Required
Generated: 2025-09-27

=== STATUS ===
‚úÖ X API credentials are working correctly
‚úÖ Bearer token generated successfully (for read operations)
‚úÖ OAuth 1.0a implementation complete
‚ùå App permissions need to be elevated for posting

=== ISSUE ===
Error: "Your client app is not configured with the appropriate oauth1 app permissions"

=== SOLUTION ===
1. Go to: https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Navigate to: Your app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí App permissions
3. Change from: "Read" to "Read and write"
4. Apply for Elevated Access (still free, usually instant approval)
5. Regenerate access tokens after changing permissions

=== WHAT THIS MEANS ===
Your current "Essential" access level allows:
‚úÖ Reading timelines, user info, searching tweets
‚ùå Posting tweets, replies, retweets, likes

"Elevated" access (still free) allows:
‚úÖ Everything from Essential access
‚úÖ Posting tweets and replies
‚úÖ Liking, retweeting, following
‚úÖ Up to 100 requests per 15 minutes (vs 75 for Essential)

=== CURRENT WORKAROUND ===
Until permissions are fixed:
1. Blog commands will save X threads to files
2. Manual copy-paste posting to X
3. Threads saved in: /home/jeremy/projects/blog/x-threads/

=== AFTER PERMISSION FIX ===
All blog+X commands will automatically:
1. Generate and publish blog post
2. Generate X thread content
3. Post thread directly to X
4. No manual intervention needed

=== FREE API THREAD ===
Here's the thread content to post manually:

üÜì Just set up X API for free!

‚úÖ 1,500 tweets/month
‚úÖ 50 tweets/day
‚úÖ Read & write access
‚úÖ $0 cost

Perfect for blog automation and personal projects. The free tier covers most individual use cases perfectly.
