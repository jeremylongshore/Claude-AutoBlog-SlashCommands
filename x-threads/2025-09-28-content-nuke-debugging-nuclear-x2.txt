TL;DR: Spent the afternoon debugging why my sophisticated content automation system wasn't working. Turned out to be a simple path issue - commands looking for analytics at `/projects/analytics/` when it was actually at `/home/jeremy/analytics/`. Sometimes the complex solutions fail for the simplest reasons. ðŸ§µ

The real lesson: when building distributed command systems, start debugging with YOUR assumptions, not external dependencies. Fixed 13 commands, synchronized the entire system, and now Content Nuke is generating this very thread!
