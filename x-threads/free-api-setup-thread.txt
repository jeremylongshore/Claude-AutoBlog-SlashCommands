=== END THREAD ===

Instructions for posting:
1. Copy each numbered tweet (1/7, 2/7, etc.)
2. Post them in sequence as a thread
3. Each tweet should be posted as a reply to the previous one
4. Wait a few seconds between posts to avoid rate limits

Note: Your X API credentials are working correctly!
✅ Bearer token generated successfully
❌ Posting tweets requires OAuth 1.0a User Context authentication (not just Bearer token)

The bearer token works for:
• Reading timelines
• Searching tweets
• Getting user info
• Other read-only operations

To post tweets programmatically, you need:
• OAuth 1.0a signature generation
• User context authentication
• More complex implementation

For now, manual posting is the simplest approach. Your credentials are valid and ready for a proper OAuth 1.0a implementation when needed.
