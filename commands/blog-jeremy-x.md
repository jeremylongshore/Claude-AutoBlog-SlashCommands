Generate and publish a portfolio blog post to jeremylongshore.com AND create a Twitter/X thread in one command.

## Your Task

This command creates a blog post for jeremylongshore.com (professional/career audience) AND generates a Twitter/X thread to promote it.

### Phase 1: Analyze Working Session (Once)

1. **Analyze ENTIRE Working Session**
   - **Git History**: Check commits since the most recent post date in `/home/jeremy/projects/blog/jeremylongshore/content/posts/` (fallback: last 14 days)
   - **Current Conversation**: Review the COMPLETE conversation history from this session
     - What problem were we solving?
     - What questions did Jeremy ask?
     - What solutions did we try that failed?
     - What troubleshooting steps did we take?
     - What was the iterative problem-solving process?
     - What did we learn along the way?
   - **Project Context**: Examine file changes, TODO lists, CLAUDE.md files in CURRENT directory
   - **Missed Opportunities**: Identify anything valuable we worked on that might not be in git yet
   - **The Journey**: Capture the full story - false starts, pivots, discoveries, not just the final solution

2. **Find Cross-Links**
   - Search existing posts in `/home/jeremy/projects/blog/jeremylongshore/content/posts/`
   - Identify 2-3 related posts by keyword/topic matching
   - Note their titles and URLs for linking

### Phase 2: Write Portfolio Blog Post

3. **Write Portfolio Blog Post**
   - **Tone:** Professional, career-focused, demonstrates problem-solving
   - **Style:** Narrative showcasing capabilities for employers/clients
   - **Same content, different narrative:**
     - Title (career-impact focused)
     - Challenge (business/professional context)
     - Approach (problem-solving methodology)
     - Solution (what was delivered)
     - Skills Demonstrated (highlight technical and soft skills)
     - Impact (professional growth, portfolio value)
     - Related Work (cross-links to 2-3 portfolio posts)
   - **Focus:** Problem-solving capabilities and professional growth
   - **Audience:** Employers, clients, recruiters
   - Use Hugo front matter (TOML format):
     ```toml
     +++
     title = 'Professional Title'
     date = 2025-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS-05:00
     draft = false
     tags = ["career", "skills"]
     +++
     ```

### Phase 3: Ask for Thread Size

4. **Prompt for Thread Size**
   - Ask: "Thread size? (1-7)"
   - User responds with just the number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7
   - Default to 3 if no response

### Phase 4: Generate X Thread
